# classification_with_python
 In this project, We will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

We load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. Y

-k-Nearest Neighbour

-Decision Tree

-Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

-Jaccard index

-F1-score

-LogLoss
